# FiveM MongoDB driver
Hello, this is my FiveM MongoDB driver!
Feel free to use it into you projects

### Description
I've developed this one 1 year ago and today I decided to give it public.
Why? The old one which was used on FiveM for a long time was so outdated. So, I created my own one started from the old one ideea.
Why to use mine? Easy to replace, faster, flexible, more logging options.

### How fast?
I've used JavaScript performance method to compare them. I made a simple query to collect all data from collection "users" where id = 1. Down you have the screenshot. 
You can also test it on your machine.

### Better logs?
Ye, it clearly have better logs. 

You have 3 options:
1. No logs (default option, no logs)

2. Only types of logs (update, updateOne, updateMany, find, findOne, findMany, delete, deleteOne, deleteMany, count, insert, insertMany, insertOne)
